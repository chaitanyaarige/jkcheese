    <h1> Delivery & Shipping Policy </h1> <br>

    
    <p>At jkcheesenmore.com, our aim is to ship our products in a quick, safe and inexpensive manner. We
deliver to all the nearby destinations within India.</p>

<h5> Processing Your Order </h5> <br>
    <p>We try our best to ship goods to you as soon as possible. On average, it takes us about 5 business
days to ship goods out of our warehouses across India. However, if the quantities ordered are more
than 5 pieces per product per style, or if the item ordered is under production, it may take longer to
process your order. Should this happen, we will keep you informed by email.</p>
    
<h5> Customs And Product Shipping </h5> <br>
<p>All of jkcheesenmore orders are shipped internationally from our warehouses across India to your
provided shipping address.The large majority of orders will not have to pay any additional fees.
However, we are unable to calculate when and how much these infrequent customs duty charges
will be levied. In the case where additional customs charges are assessed, you will be responsible
for paying these additional fees. To make your shopping experience as seamless as possible, we
have arranged with the best of delivery services to customs clear your goods for you and deliver
them to your doorstep. If you are presented with an invoice from import duties and taxes, you will
have to pay them directly at the time of delivery.</p>

<p>For more information about shipping and delivery, please see our Shipping FAQs.</p>
